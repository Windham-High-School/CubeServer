""" CubeServer model utils codecs

This package contains BSON/PyMongo TypeCodecs for a handful
of common types. These are built-into the AutoEncodable encoding
scheme, but can be used independently as well.
Under *most* normal usage, these codecs are automatically registered
and you don't have to worry about these types.
