                To ensure that the competition remains fair and trustworthy, 
                this secret is used by the api to ensure that no other team is 
                capable of impersonating your data. This eliminates the 
                possibility of one team attempting to sabotage another by sending 
                false data, as well as reducing unfair cooperation between teams.
                The server can then verify that your data is legitimately
                coming from your microcontroller.
