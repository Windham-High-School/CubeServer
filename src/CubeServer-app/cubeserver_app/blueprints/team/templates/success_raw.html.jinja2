        <p>
            To ensure that the competition remains fair and trustworthy, 
            this secret is used by the api to ensure that no other team is 
            capable of impersonating your data. This eliminates the 
            possibility of one team attempting to sabotage another by sending 
            false data, as well as reducing unfair cooperation between teams.
            The server can then verify that your data is legitimately
            coming from your microcontroller.
