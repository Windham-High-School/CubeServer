## Authorization Scheme:
Pre-shared strings:
* Team Name
    - The team name, exactly as it appears on the leaderboard, will be used to identify the team whose device is making the request.
* Team secret
    - The hexedecimal key generated by the server upon team registration; This will be used by the API client to sign any requests from the devices for authenticity
    - This will then be used by the server to sign the responses

## Headers:
The "Signature" HTTP header will contain a signature of the request body in requests, and the same header will contain a signature of the response body in responses as described above.
