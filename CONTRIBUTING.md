# Contributing to CubeServer

Firstly, thank you to anyone interested in helping out- I hope you get a chance to learn something valuable!

Contributing to CubeServer should imply **no commitment**, other than to communicate if plans change and you need someone else to take something over. Reflexively, we hope to communicate back and respond to any questions you might have in a timely manner.

## Current Scope

Currently, we are working to deploy CubeServer for a competition at [WHS](https://github.com/Windham-High-School). Because this project's scope is localized, contributions from outside the organization are not currently expected. The majority of general communications will occur through the [cubeserver-dev GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/Windham-High-School/teams/cubeserver-dev).
